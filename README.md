## An appealing JS app to learn vocabulary.

## Drag the txt-file onto the app to get started.

Creator comment: Vocz was my first JS application, written several years ago out of personal need / desire. Today, knowing JS and CSS better, I would write much of the code differently (like using less global variables, and rather objects). It is perfectly stable though and the code is coherent.
